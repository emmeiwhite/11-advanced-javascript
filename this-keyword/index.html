    <h1>this - keyword</h1>

    <p>
      Every Execution Context - Be it Global or Functional contains a special object call the this
      keyword.
    </p>

    <p>
      this keyword is like a variable but whole value depends on the context as well as how the
      function in which it is present is invoked. It doesn't depend on Lexical Scope, rather the
      value of this depends on how the function is called!
