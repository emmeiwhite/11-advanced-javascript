    <h1>✅ First Topic: Memoization</h1>

    <h2>🔹 Why do we need Memoization?</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes you call the same function again and again with the same input, and it repeats heavy
      calculations unnecessarily. Memoization helps you cache the result so you don’t recalculate
      it.
    </p>

    <h2>🔹 What is Memoization?</h2>
    <p>Think of it like saying:</p>

    <p>
      “If I’ve already answered this question before, I’ll just give you the same answer instantly —
      no thinking needed!”
    </p>

    <p>
      🔹 Real-Life Analogy You're asked, “What’s 12 x 12?” — first time you calculate it. Next time,
      you remember it’s 144. That’s memoization.
