# Advanced JavaScript Concepts

- Promises: An object which is pending, resolves or is rejected
- Closures: When an inner function has access to the outer function scope, then the inner function along with the outer lexical scope forms a closure. The inner function can access the outer function variables even after the outer function has returned and finished its execution.
- Debouncing: Debouncing is a technique to delay a function call until the user has stopped performing an action for a set period of time.
