    <h1>⚡️ What is Debouncing?</h1>
    <p>
      Debouncing is a technique to delay a function call until the user has stopped performing an
      action for a set period of time.
    </p>

    <h2>🔹 WHY do we need it?</h2>
    <p>Imagine a user is typing in a search bar. Without debouncing:</p>
    <li>You fire an API request on every keystroke (wasteful, heavy on performance).</li>
    <p>With debouncing:</p>
    <li>You wait until the user stops typing for, say, 500ms, and then fire the request.</li>

    <h2>📱 Real-World Analogy</h2>
    <p>
      You call someone’s name, they don't respond immediately — they wait a few seconds to ensure
      you’re not calling again. That’s debouncing.

    <h1>Search Products</h1>
    <form id="searchForm">
      <input
        type="text"
        name="searchTerm"
        id="searchInput"
        placeholder="Search for products..."
        style="width: 400px; padding: 3px" />
    </form>

    <section class="productsWrapper">
      <!-- Loading -->
      <!-- Data -->
      <!-- Error -->
